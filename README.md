# React Landing Page Starter

This project is a scalable React + TypeScript setup, bootstrapped with Vite. It is designed as a foundation for a landing web page, with best practices for future scaling.

## Features
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and build
- Ready for component-based scaling
- Easy to add routing, state management, and more

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Scaling Suggestions
- Organize components in `src/components/`
- Add routing with `react-router-dom` for multi-page support
- Use `src/pages/` for page-level components
- Add global state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand) as needed
- Use `src/assets/` for images and static files

Happy coding!
